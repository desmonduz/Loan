# Student Default Rates in 2010-2012

This project analysis the default rate of students in the US. The data is provided by Federal Perkins Loan Program and Federal Student Aid department. I have used following resources in analysing this data:

- [Federal Perkins Loan Program Status of Default](http://ifap.ed.gov/perkinscdrguide/1415PerkinsCDR.html)
- [Three-year Official Cohort Default Rates for Schools](http://www2.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/defaultmanagement/cdr.html)
